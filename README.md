Built With

    Unity: We’re using Unity to bring the game to life. It's fast and efficient for building 2D games, and we’re making full use of it here!
    C#: The game logic is powered by C#. This is where all the jumping, dodging, and trap interactions come to life.
    GitHub & Git LFS: We’re using Git to manage the project and Git LFS (Large File Storage) for all the big assets like textures and models.
